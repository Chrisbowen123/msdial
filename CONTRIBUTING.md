## Did you find a bug?


## Do you have questions about MS-DIAL / MS-FINDER ?



## Coding conventions
- We use XXXXX for XXXXX.
- We avoid logic in views, putting XXXXX into XXXXX.
- We ALWAYS put spaces after XXXXXX items and method parameters(FILL_ME_THE_EXAMPLE), around operators (FILL_ME_THE_EXAMPLE), and around hash arrows.
- We indent using two spaces (soft tabs).

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?
